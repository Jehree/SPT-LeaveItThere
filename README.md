## Leave It There now has a set of addon tools!

The tools below have been created so that mod authors can make addons for Leave It there that add extra functionality to placed items. You could use this to make something simple like a lamp that can be turned on and off, or more complex like a crafting bench. These tools just expose what's needed from Leave It There to apply those things to an item that is placed, as well as offer some utilities.
