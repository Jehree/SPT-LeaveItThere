## Leave It There now has a set of addon tools!

The tools below have been created so that mod authors can make addons for Leave It there that add extra functionality to placed items, as well as offer some utilities.

They were developed initially for my own addon: [HomeComforts](https://github.com/Jehree/SPT-HomeComforts/tree/main)
